Session Starter Template (Copy-Paste Ready):
markdown# BLENDER ANIMATION LIBRARY - SESSION CONTEXT

## PROJECT STATUS:
üéØ GOAL: Professional Blender animation asset management with video previews
üìç CURRENT PHASE: [Replacing thumbnails with video previews]

## ARCHITECTURE:
- Blender Addon: `src/blender_animation_library/` (Python)
- GUI Application: `src/gui/` (PySide6/Qt)  
- Core Logic: `src/core/` (Python)
- Communication: Socket-based real-time connection

## KEY DESIGN DECISIONS:
‚úÖ Video previews (.mp4) replace static thumbnails (.png) entirely
‚úÖ Folder structure: animations/Root/, previews/Root/ (no thumbnails/)
‚úÖ .blend file optimization for 99% performance improvement
‚úÖ Real-time preview updates from Blender viewport

üíæ State Management System

üéØ Session Management Rules
Before Each LLM Session:

Update project_state.json - Current status
Choose specific template - Don't start from scratch
One task only - Resist scope creep
Copy exact error messages - Don't paraphrase
List specific files - Don't be vague

After Each Session:

Document what worked - Add to templates
Update state file - Current status
Note any new issues - For next session
Backup working code - Git commits
Plan next specific task - Be ready

üìà Advantages of This Approach
Compared to Open Source:
‚úÖ Keep IP private - No competitive forks
‚úÖ Control development pace - No community pressure
‚úÖ Monetize freely - No license restrictions
‚úÖ Strategic advantage - First-to-market position
Compared to Hiring Developers:
‚úÖ Much cheaper - No salary/hourly costs
‚úÖ Available 24/7 - Work on your schedule
‚úÖ No management overhead - No team coordination
‚úÖ Learning opportunity - You understand the code
Long-term Sustainability:
‚úÖ Template library grows - Gets easier over time
‚úÖ Documented patterns - Reusable solutions
‚úÖ State tracking - Never lose context
‚úÖ Incremental progress - Steady improvement
This approach lets you maintain control while systematically building a valuable commercial product. The key is discipline in using templates and maintaining state - but that's much easier than managing an open source community or hiring developers.
